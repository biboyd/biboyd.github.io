# Graduate
Here are some projects and other things I did as a grad student in different courses. 

## Stars
In my stars course we were assigned a final project in which we needed to investigate something about stars/stellar evolution. I decided to use the MESA stellar evolution code to learn more about how it treats convection and how shifting the parameters that control convection can impact a star.

I ended up having some difficulty with running MESA locally so I ended up using the MESA-web platfrom which was incredibly useful.

The full report can be downloaded [here](/assets/Stars_proj.pdf).
