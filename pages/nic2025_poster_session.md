I presented this poster at the NIC 2025 Meeting in Girona.
My poster is on our latest models of the convective Urca process in simmering white dwarfs and the inclusion/testing of a far more advanced nuclear network

## Improved Nuclear Network for Studying the Convective Urca Process in Type Ia Supernova Progenitor

This research was supported in part by the US Department of Energy (DOE) under grant DE-FG02-87ER40317
