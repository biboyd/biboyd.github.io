Hello, I'm Brendan Boyd, a graduate student in the Physics & Astronomy Department at Stony Brook University. I graduated from Michigan State University with a B.S. in Astrophysics. At MSU I worked with Devin Silvia and Brian O'Shea studying the CGM of galactic simulations as a part of the [FOGGIE](https://foggie.science) collaboration.

Near the end of my time with that group I created the python package [SALSA](https://github.com/biboyd/SALSA) which was then published in [JOSS][salsa-paper] (Journal of Open Source Software). The package uses multiple other open-source python packages to make a streamlined analysis pipeline to generate synthetic observations from galactic simulation data. More information on that package can be found in the [JOSS paper][salsa-paper] and the [documentation](https://salsa.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest) made for the tool.

Currently I'm not directly engaged in any research projects. My fairly general interests are in computation and modeling of physics and in partiular astrophysics as it gives some of the most interesting objects to study. 

Outside of doing homework and other physics type stuff, I enjoy reading and watching movies which I track on my [letterboxd](https://letterboxd.com/bbbyeah/).
