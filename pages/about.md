Hello, I'm Brendan Boyd, a graduate student in the Physics & Astronomy Department at Stony Brook University and a member of the Nucelar Astro group, working with [Alan Calder](http://www.astro.sunysb.edu/acalder/). I graduated from Michigan State University with a B.S. in Astrophysics. At MSU I worked with Devin Silvia and Brian O'Shea studying the Circumgalactic Medium via galactic simulations as a part of the [FOGGIE](https://foggie.science) collaboration.

Near the end of my time with that group I created the python package [SALSA](https://github.com/biboyd/SALSA) which was then published in [JOSS][salsa-paper] (Journal of Open Source Software). The package uses multiple other open-source python packages to make a streamlined analysis pipeline to generate synthetic observations from galactic simulation data. More information on that package can be found in the [JOSS paper][salsa-paper] and the [documentation](https://salsa.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest) made for the tool.

Currently I'm working with the Nuclear Astrophysics group at Stony Brook. In particular, I am working on studying the convective URCA process in White Dwarfs with Dr. Alan Calder. To do this we are utilizing the [AMReX][amrex-astro] based code [MAESTROeX][maestro]. This is a continuation of the work done by Don Willcox, and represents the first full 3D simulations of this process. 

Outside of doing homework and other physics type stuff, I enjoy reading and watching movies which I track on my [letterboxd](https://letterboxd.com/bbbyeah/). I've more recently gotten interested in baking bread and may make a dedicated page to that at some point.
