Howdy, I'm Brendan Boyd, a graduate student in the Physics & Astronomy Department at Stony Brook University. I graduated from Michigan State University with a B.S. in Astrophysics. At MSU I worked with Devin Silvia and Brian O'Shea studying the CGM of galactic simulations as a part of the [FOGGIE][foggie] collaboration.
