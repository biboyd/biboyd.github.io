Well this is my first post so I hope you really enjoy it. Mostly just testing things but maybe you'll find something interesting (you won't).



I guess I'll just toss in some python code block thing
{% highlight python %}
def add_one(foo):
    return foo + '1'
add_one('Tom')
#=> returns 'Tom1' 
{% endhighlight %}

Welp this is the end of the post. I guess I'll just toss a link in here for good measure, my [github page][biboyd-git]
